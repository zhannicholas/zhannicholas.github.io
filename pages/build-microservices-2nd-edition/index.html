  + A microservice makes a call to another microservice and blocks operation waiting for the response.

  + Synchronous blocking is simple. However, the main challenge with synchronous calls is the **inherent temporal coupling** that occurs.

  + The sender of the call will be blocked for a prolonged period of time waiting for a response if the downstream microservice is slow.

+ ### Asynchronous nonblocking

  + The microservice emitting a call is able to carry on processing whether or not the call is received.

  + With nonblocking asynchronous communication, the microservice making the initial call and the microservice (or microservices) receiving the call are **decoupled temporally**.
  + The main downsides of nonblocking asynchronous communication, relative to blocking synchronous communication, are the level of complexity and the range of choice.

+ ### Request-response

  + A microservice sends a request to another microservice asking for something to be done. It expects to receive a response informing it of the result.

  + All forms of request-response interaction are likely going to require some form of time-out handling to avoid issues where the system gets blocked waiting for something that may never happen.

+ ### Event-driven

  + Microservices emit events, which other microservices consume and react to accordingly. The microservice emitting the event is unaware of which microservices, if any, consume the events it emits.

+ ### Common data

  + Microservices collaborate via some shared data source.

  + This pattern is used when one microservice puts data into a defined location, and another microservice (or potentially multiple microservices) then makes use of the data.

In the context of RPC, the schema is often referred to as an interface definition language (IDL).

A sender puts a message on a queue, and a consumer reads from that queue.</p></li><li><p>With a topic-based system, multiple consumers are able to subscribe to a topic, and each subscribed consumer will receive a copy of that message.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>A queue allows for one consumer group.

Testing</h1><ul><li><h2 id=types-of-tests>Types of Tests</h2><ul><li>Brian Marick&rsquo;s testing quadrant.</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492034018/files/assets/bms2_0901.png alt></p><pre><code>  + At the bottom of the quadrant, we have tests that are *technology facing*—that is, tests that aid the developers in creating the system in the first place.

  + The top half of the quadrant includes those tests that help the nontechnical stakeholders understand how your system works, which we call *business-facing* tests.

  + The ability to automate some tasks, such as verifying how something looks, was previously limited exclusively to manual exploratory testing. The maturing of tooling that enables visual assertions has allowed us to start automating tasks that were previously done manually. You shouldn’t see this as a reason to have no manual testing, though; you should instead see it as a chance to free up testers’ time to focus on less repetitive, *exploratory* testing.

  + Automation as a way of freeing up our brainpower for the things we do best.
</code></pre><ul><li><h2 id=test-scope>Test Scope</h2><ul><li>Mike Cohn&rsquo;s test pyramid</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492034018/files/assets/bms2_0902.png alt></p><pre><code>  + The key thing to take away when reading the pyramid is that as we go up the pyramid, the test scope increases, as does our confidence that the functionality being tested works. On the other hand, the feedback cycle time increases as the tests take longer to run, and when a test fails, it can be harder to determine which functionality has broken.

  + As we go down the pyramid, in general the tests become much faster, so we get much faster feedback cycles. we don’t get a lot of confidence that our system as a whole works if we’ve tested only a small portion.

+ ### Unit Tests

  + Unit tests typically test a single function or method call.

  + The tests generated as a side effect of *test-driven design* (TDD) will fall into this category, as do the sorts of tests generated by techniques such as property-based testing.

  + Unit tests help us developers and thus would be technology facing, not business facing, in Marick’s terminology. They are also where we hope to catch most of our bugs.

  + Unit tests would cover small parts of the code in isolation.

  + The primary goal of these tests is to give us very fast feedback about whether our functionality is good.

  + Unit tests are also important for supporting refactoring of code, allowing us to restructure our code as we go secure in the knowledge that our small-scoped tests will catch us if we make a mistake.

+ ### Service Tests

  + Service tests are designed to bypass the user interface and test our microservices directly.

  + By running tests against a single microservice in this way, we get increased confidence that the service will behave as we expect, but we still keep the scope of the test somewhat isolated.

  + Our service tests want to test a slice of functionality across the whole microservice, and only that microservice. Thus, our service test suite needs to stub out downstream collaborators and configure the microservice under test to connect to the stub services.

  + [mountebank](http://www.mbtest.org/) is a smart stub/mock service.

+ ### End-to-End Tests

  + End-to-end tests are tests run against your entire system.

  + To implement an end-to-end test, we need to deploy multiple microservices together, and then run a test against all of them. Obviously, this test has a much larger scope, resulting in more confidence that our system works!

  + If you have tests that sometimes fail, but everyone just reruns them because they may pass again later, then you have **flaky tests**.

    + <div class=caution>
    When we detect flaky tests, it is essential that we do our best to remove them. Otherwise, we start to lose faith in a test suite that “always fails like that.”
</div>

  + #### Contract Tests and Consumer-Driven Contracts (CDCs)

    + With **contract tests**, a team whose microservice consumes an external service writes tests that describe how it expects an external service will behave. This is less about testing your own microservice and more about specifying how you expect an external service to behave.

    + A good practice in CDCs is to have someone from the producer and consumer teams collaborate on creating the tests.

    + In cross-team collaboration, CDCs are an explicit reminder of Conway’s law.

    + CDCs tests are focused on how a consumer will use the service, and the trigger if they break is very different when compared with service tests.

    + With CDCs, we can identify a breaking change prior to our software going into production without having to use a potentially expensive end-to-end test.

It can be useful to measure this with different numbers of users to understand how increasing load will impact the response time. Given the nature of networks, you’ll always have outliers, so setting targets for a given percentile of the responses monitored can be useful. The target should also include the number of concurrent connections/users you will expect your software to handle.

Look at “normal” healthy response times for your downstream services, and use that to guide where you set the time-out threshold.</p></li><li><p>Don’t just think about the time-out for a single service call; also think about a time-out for the overall operation, and abort the operation if this overall time-out budget is exceeded.</p></li></ul></li><li><h3 id=retries>Retries</h3><ul><li><p>Some issues with downstream calls are temporary. Often, retrying the call can make a lot of sense.</p></li><li><p>You will likely need to have a delay before retrying. If the initial time-out or error was caused by the fact that the downstream microservice was under load, then bombarding it with additional requests may well be a bad idea.</p></li></ul></li><li><h3 id=bulkheads>Bulkheads</h3><ul><li><p>In Release It!, Michael Nygard introduces the concept of a bulkhead as a way to isolate yourself from failure.</p></li><li><p>Separation of concerns can also be a way to implement bulkheads. By teasing apart functionality into separate microservices, we reduce the chance of an outage in one area affecting another.</p></li></ul></li><li><h3 id=circuit-breakers>Circuit Breakers</h3><ul><li>With a circuit breaker, after a certain number of requests to the downstream resource have failed (due either to error or to a time-out), the circuit breaker is blown. All further requests that go through that circuit breaker fail fast while the breaker is in its blown (open) state. After a certain period of time, the client sends a few requests through to see if the downstream service has recovered, and if it gets enough healthy responses it resets the circuit breaker.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492034018/files/assets/bms2_1205.png alt></p><pre><code>+ ### Isolation

  + The more one microservice depends on another microservice being available, the more the health of one impacts the ability of the other to do its job.

+ ### Redundancy

  + Having more copies of something can help when it comes to implementing redundancy, but it can also be beneficial when it comes to scaling our applications to handle increased load.

+ ### Idempotency

  + In idempotent operations, the outcome doesn’t change after the first application, even if the operation is subsequently applied multiple times. If operations are idempotent, we can repeat the call multiple times without adverse impact.
