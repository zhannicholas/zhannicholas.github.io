  + The software architecture is a constantly moving target because of the rapidly evolving software development ecosystem.

architecture point of view.</p></li><li><p>As shown in figure below (The pyramid representing all knowledge), any individual can partition all their knowledge into three sections:* stuff you know*, *stuff</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>you know you don&rsquo;t know*, <em>stuff you don&rsquo;t

+ Understanding the difference between genuine(真正的) versus perceived(表面上看起来是的) technical risk is part of the ongoing learning process for architecture. Thinking like an architect requires overcoming these &quot;frozen caveman&quot; ideas and experiences, seeing other solutions, and asking more relevant questions.

One way to avoid the bottleneck trap is to delegate the critical path to others.

+ If an architect is not able to develop code with development team, there're several basic ways to remain hands-on and maintain some level of technical depth:


  + Do frequent proof-of-concepts or POCs. A good advice is, whenever possible, write the best production-ready code as possible as they can.

  + Tackle some of the technical debt stories or architecture stories (usually low priority), freeing the development team up to work on the critical functional user stories.

  + Working on bug fixes with an iteration.

  + Leveraging automation by creating simple command-line tools and analyzers to help the development team with their day-to-day tasks.

  + Do frequent code reviews.

. A</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>fallacy (谬论) is something that is believed or assumed to be true but is not. All eight of the fallacies of distributed computing apply to distributed architectures today.</p><pre><code>  + **Fallacy #1: The Network Is Reliable**

    + While networks have become more reliable over time, the fact of the matter is that network still remain generally unreliable. The more a system relies on the network, the potentially less reliable it becomes.

  + **Fallacy #2: Latency Is Zero**

    + Local in-memory method call is measured in nanoseconds, but remote access call, such as REST is measured in milliseconds. Latency in any distributed architecture is not zero, yet most architects ignore this fallacy, insisting they have fast networks.

    + When using any distributed architecture, architects must know the **average latency**. It's the only way of determining whether a distributed architecture is feasible, particularly in microservices. Knowing the average latency is important, but even more important is also knowing the **95th **and **99th** percentile. Usually the &quot;long tail&quot; latency will kill performance in  a distributed architecture.

  + **Fallacy #3: Bandwidth Is Infinite**

    + Bandwidth is usually not a concern in monolithic architecture, but when a systems are broken apart into smaller deployment units (services), these services significantly utilizes bandwidth, causing networks to slow down, thus impact latency (fallacy #2) and reliability (fallacy #1).*

    + Stamp coupling* occurs when modules share a composite data structure and use parts of it, often consumes significant amount of bandwidth. The best way to address this fallacy is to ensuring the minimal amount of data is passed between services.

  + **Fallacy #4: The Network Is Secure**

    + Even VPN, trusted networks and firewalls are used, security still becomes much more challenging in a distributed architecture.

  + **Fallacy #5: The Topology Never Changes**

    + The network topology includes routers, hubs, switches, firewalls, networks, and appliances used within the overall network. Architects assume that the topology is fixed and never changes. *Of course it changes, it changes all the time*.

  + **Fallacy #6: There Is Only One Administrator**

    + Architects all the time fall into this fallacy, assuming they only need to collaborate and communicate with on administrator. In fact, there're many network administrators.

  + **Fallacy #7: Transport Cost Is Zero**

    + Transport cost here refers to money associated with making a remote call.

  + **Fallacy #8: The Network Is Homogeneous**

    + Many architects and developers assume a network is homogeneous---made up by only one network hardware vendor. The truth is that most companies have multiple network hardware vendors in their infrastructure, if not more.

Event-driven architecture is made up of decoupled event processing components that asynchronously receive and process events.</p></li><li><p>Event-based model reacts to a particular situation and takes action based on that event.</p></li><li><h3 id=topology-4>Topology</h3><ul><li>There are two primary topologies within event-driven architecture: the mediator topology and the broker topology. The <em><strong>mediator topology</strong></em> is commonly used when you require control over the workflow of an event process, whereas the ***broker topology ***is used when you require a high degree of responsiveness and dynamic control over the processing of an event.</li></ul></li><li><h3 id=broker-topology>Broker Topology</h3><ul><li><p>The broker topology differs from the mediator topology in that <em>there is no central event mediator</em>. It&rsquo;s useful when you have a relatively simple event processing flow and you do not need central event orchestration and coordination.</p></li><li><p>There are four primary architecture components within the broker topology: an initiating event, the event broker, an event processor, and a processing event.</p></li><li><p>The initiating event the is initial event that starts the entire flow, it&rsquo;s send to an event channel in the event broker for processing, a single event processor accepts the initiating event from the event broker and begins to processing of that event, then asynchronously advertises what it did to the rest of the system by creating what is called a processing event.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=https://zhannicholas.github.io/assets/fundamentals-of-software-architecture/fosa_1402.png alt></p><pre><code>+ It is always a good practice within the broker topology for each event processor to advertise what it did to the rest of the system, regardless of whether or not any other event processor cares about what that action was. This practice provides architectural **extensibility** if additional functionality is required for the processing of that event.
</code></pre><p><img src=https://zhannicholas.github.io/assets/fundamentals-of-software-architecture/fosa_1403.png alt></p><pre><code>+ The best way to understand the broker topology is to think it as a relay race (接力赛). Once an event processor hands off the event, it is no longer involved with the processing of that specific event and is available to react to other initiating or procesing event.

+ While performance, responsiveness, and scalability are all great
</code></pre><p>benefits of the broker topology, there are also some negatives about it:</p><pre><code>  + There's no control over the overall workflow associated with the initiating event, it's very dynamic based on various conditions.

  + Because there's no mediator monitoring or controlling the business transaction, error handling is a big problem.

  + The ability to restart a business transaction (recoverability) is not supported.

  + No component in the broker topology is aware of the state or even owns the state of the original business request, and therefore no one is responsible for restarting the business transaction and knowing where it left off.

+ Here are some trade-offs of the broker topology:
</code></pre><ul><li><h3 id=mediator-topology>Mediator Topology</h3><ul><li><p>The mediator topology addresses some of the shortcomings of the broker topology. Central to this topology is an event mediator, which manages and controls the workflow for initiating events that require the coordination of multiple event processors.</p></li><li><p>The architecture components that make up the mediator topology  are an initiating event, an event queue, an event mediator, event channels, and event processors.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=https://zhannicholas.github.io/assets/fundamentals-of-software-architecture/fosa_1405.png alt></p><pre><code>+ The event mediator only knows the steps involved in processing the event and therefore generates corresponding processing event that are sent to dedicated event channels in a point-to-point messaging fashion.

+ It is important to know the type of the events that will processed through the mediator in order to make the correct choice for the implementation of the event coordinator.

+ Given that it's rare to have all events of one class of complexity, classifying events as simple, hard, or complex and having every event always go through a simple mediator is recommended.
</code></pre><p><img src=https://zhannicholas.github.io/assets/fundamentals-of-software-architecture/fosa_1406.png alt></p><pre><code>+ Because the mediator controls the workflow, it can maintain event state and manage error handling, recoverability, and restart capabilities.

+ Another inherent difference between the broker and mediator topology is how the processing events differ in terms of their meaning and how they are used. In broker topology, processing occurrences are ***events ***(things that have already happened). However, processing occurrences are ***commands*** (things that need to happed). Also, in the mediator topology,  a command must be processed, whereas an event can be ignored in the broker topology.

+ Trade-offs of the mediator topology is listed below:

  + | Advantages | Disadvantages |
</code></pre><p>|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;|
| Workflow control | More coupling of event processors |
| Error handling | Lower scalability |
| Recoverability | Lower performance |
| Restart capabilities | Lower fault tolerance |
| Better data consistency | Modeling complex workflows |</p><pre><code>+ The choice between the broker and mediator topology essentially comes down to a trade-off between workflow control and error handling capability versus high performance and scalability.
</code></pre><ul><li><h3 id=asynchronous-capabilities>Asynchronous Capabilities</h3><ul><li><p>The event-driven architecture style offers a unique characteristic over other architecture styles in that it relies solely on asynchronous communication for both fire-and-forget processing (no response required) as well as request/reply processing (response required from the event consumer).</p></li><li><p><em>When the user does not need any information back (other than an acknowledgement or a thank you message), don&rsquo;t make the user wait, use asynchronous instead.</em></p></li><li><p>The main issue with asynchronous communications is error handling. While responsiveness is significantly improved, it is difficult to address error conditions, adding the complexity to the event-driven system.</p></li></ul></li><li><h3 id=error-handling>Error Handling</h3><ul><li>The workflow event pattern of reactive architecture is one way of addressing the issues associated with error handling in an asynchronous workflow. It leverages delegation, containment, and repair through the use of a workflow delegate.</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=https://zhannicholas.github.io/assets/fundamentals-of-software-architecture/fosa_1414.png alt></p><pre><code>+ The event producer asynchronously passes data through a message channel to the event consumer. If the event consumer experiences an error while processing the data, it immediately delegates that error to the workflow processor and move on to the next message in the event queue. For example:
</code></pre><p><img src=https://zhannicholas.github.io/assets/fundamentals-of-software-architecture/fosa_1415.png alt></p><pre><code>+ One of the consequences of the workflow event pattern is that messages in error are processed out of sequence when they are resubmitted.
</code></pre><ul><li><h3 id=preventing-data-loss>Preventing Data Loss</h3><ul><li><p>Data loss is always a primary concern when dealing with asynchronous communications.</p></li><li><p>Unfortunately, there are many places for data loss to occur within an event-driven architecture.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=https://zhannicholas.github.io/assets/fundamentals-of-software-architecture/fosa_1416.png alt></p><pre><code>+ Fortunately, there are basic out-of-the-box techniques that can be leveraged to prevent data loss when using asynchronous messaging.


  + Each of these areas of data loss can be mitigated through basic messaging techniques.

  + Issue 1 (the message never makes it to the queue) is easily solved by leveraging ***persistent message queues***, along with something called ***synchronous send***. Persisted message queues support what is known as *guaranteed delivery. *

  + Issue 2 (Event Processor B de-queues the next available message and crashes before it can process the event) can be solved by using a basic technique of messaging called ***client acknowledge mode***.

  + Issue 3 (Event Processor B is unable to persistent the message to the database due to some data error) is addressed through leveraging ACID transactions via database commit. Leveraging something called ***last participant support (LPS)*** removes the message form the persisted queue by acknowledging that processing has been completed and that the message has been persisted.

Each event channel within a request-reply messaging consists of two queues: a request queue and a reply queue. The initial request for information is asynchronously sent to the request queue, and then control is returned to the message producer. The message producer then does a blocking wait on the reply queue, waiting for the response. The message consumer receives and processes the message and then sends the response to the reply queue. The event producer then receives the message with the response data.</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=https://zhannicholas.github.io/assets/fundamentals-of-software-architecture/fosa_1419.png alt></p><pre><code>+ There are two primary techniques for implementing request-reply messaging.

Space-Based Architecture Style</h2><ul><li><p>In any high-volume application with a large concurrent user load, the database will usually be the final limiting factor in how many transactions you can process concurrently.</p></li><li><p>The *space-based *architecture style is specifically designed to addresses problems involving high scalability, elasticity, and high concurrency issues.</p></li><li><h3 id=generally-topology>Generally Topology</h3><ul><li><p>Space-based architecture get its name from the concept of tuple space, the technique of using multiple parallel processors communicating through shared memory. High scalability, high elasticity, and high performance are achieved by removing the central database as a synchronous constraint in the system and instead leveraging** replicated in-memory data grids**. Application data is kept in-memory and replicated among all the active processing units. When a processing unit updates data, it asynchronously sends that data to the database, usually via messaging with persistent queues.</p></li><li><p>Processing units start up and shut down dynamically as user load increases and decreases, thereby addressing variable scalability. Because there is no central database involved in the standard transactional processing of the application, the database bottleneck is removed, thus providing nearly infinite scalability within the application.</p></li><li><p>There are several architecture components that make up a space-based architecture: a <em><strong>processing unit</strong></em> containing the application code, <em><strong>virtualized middleware</strong></em> used to manage and coordinate the processing units, <em><strong>data pumps</strong></em> to asynchronously send updated data to the database, <em><strong>data writers</strong></em> that perform the updates from the data pumps, and <em><strong>data readers</strong></em> that read database data and deliver it to processing units upon startup.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=https://zhannicholas.github.io/assets/fundamentals-of-software-architecture/fosa_1502.png alt></p><pre><code>+ #### Processing unit

  + The processing unit contains the application logic, usually including web-based components as well as business logic.

+ #### Virtualized Middleware


  + The virtualized middleware handles the infrastructure concerns within the architecture that control various aspects of data synchronization and request handling. It includes a *messaging grid, data grid, processing grid, and deployment manager*.

  + ##### Messaging grid


    + The messaging grid managers input requests and session state, it determines a incoming request is handled by which active processing components.

    + The data grid component is perhaps the most important and crucial component in this architecture style. In most modern implementations the data grid is implemented solely within the processing units as a replicated cache.

    + Each processing unit knows about all other processing unit instances through the use of a ***member list***. The member list contains the IP addresses and ports of all other processing units using the same named cache.

  + ##### Processing grid


    + The processing grid is an optional component within the virtualized middleware that manages orchestrated request processing when there are multiple processing units involved in a single business request.

    + The deployment manager component manages the dynamic startup and shutdown of processing unit instances based on load conditions.

+ #### Data pumps


  + A data pump is a way of sending data to another processor which when updates data in a database. Data pumps within a space-based architecture are always asynchronous, providing eventual consistency with the in-memory cache and the database.

  + Data pumps are usually implemented using messaging.
</code></pre><p><img src=https://zhannicholas.github.io/assets/fundamentals-of-software-architecture/fosa_1507.png alt></p><pre><code>+ #### Data Writers


  + The data writer component accepts messages from a data pump and updates the database with the information contained in the message of the data pump.

+ #### Data Readers


  + Data readers take the responsibility for reading data from the database and sending it to the processing units via a reverse data pump.

Microservices Architecture</h2><ul><li><p>Microservices is heavily inspired by the ideas in domain-driven design (DDD), a logical design process for software projects. One concept in particular from DDD, <em><strong>bounded context</strong></em>, decidedly inspired microservices. The concept of bounded context represents a decoupling style.</p></li><li><p>In a traditional monolithic architecture, developers would try to building reusable classes and database schemas. While reuse is beneficial, remember the First Law of Software Architecture regarding trade-offs. The negative trade-off of reuse is coupling.</p></li><li><p>However, if the architect&rsquo;s goal requires high degrees of decoupling, then they favor duplication over reuse. The primary goal of microservices is <em><strong>high decoupling</strong></em>, physically modeling the logical notion of bounded context.</p></li><li><h3 id=topology-5>Topology</h3><ul><li>The topology of microservices is shown below:</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=https://zhannicholas.github.io/assets/fundamentals-of-software-architecture/fosa_1701.png alt></p><pre><code>+ Architects expect each service to include all necessary parts to operate independently, including databases and other dependent components.

Decoupling the services to this degree allows for a simple solution to a common problem in architectures that heavily feature multitenant infrastructure for hosting applications.</p></li><li><p>Separating each service into its own process solves the problems brought on by sharing.</p></li><li><p>Performance is often the negative side effect of the distributed nature of microservices. Network calls take much longer than method calls, and security verification on every endpoints adds additional processing time, requiring architects to think carefully about he implications of granularity when design the system.</p></li></ul></li><li><h3 id=bounded-context>Bounded Context</h3><ul><li><p>The driving philosophy of microservices is the notion of <em>bounded context</em>: each service models a domain of workflow. Microservices take the concept of domain-partitioned architecture of the extreme, each service is meant to represent a domain of subdomain.</p></li><li><h4 id=granularity>Granularity</h4><ul><li><p>Architects struggle to find the correct granularity for services in microservices.</p></li><li><blockquote class=hint>The term &ldquo;microservice&rdquo; is a label, not a description.
&mdash; Martin Fowler</blockquote></li><li><p>However, many developers take the term &ldquo;microservices&rdquo; as a commandment, not a description, and create services that are too fine-grained.</p></li><li><p>The purpose of service  boundaries in microservices is to capture a domain of workflow. Here some guidelines architects can use to help find the appropriate boundaries:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The most obvious boundary relies on the inspiration for the architecture style, a domain.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transactions</strong>: Bounded contexts are business workflow, and often the entities that need to cooperate in a transaction show architects a good service boundary.</p></li><li><p><strong>Choreography</strong>: If an architect builds a set of services that offer excellent domain isolation yet require extensive communication to function, the architect may consider bundling these services back into a larger service to avoid the communication overhead.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Iteration is the only way to ensure good service design.</p></li></ul></li><li><h3 id=data-isolation>Data Isolation</h3><ul><li>Another requirement of microservices, driven by the bounded context concept, is data isolation.

Finding the correct communication help teams keep services decoupled yet still coordinated in useful ways.</p></li><li><p>Fundamentally, architects must decide on <em>synchronous</em> or *asynchronous *communication. Microservices architectures typically utilize <em><strong>protocol-aware heterogeneous interoperability</strong></em>.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Protocol-aware</strong>: Because microservices usually don&rsquo;t include a centralized integration hub to avoid operational coupling, each service should know how to call other services.</p></li><li><p><strong>Heterogeneous</strong>: Each service may be written in a different technology stack. <em>Heterogeneous</em> suggests that microservices fully supports polyglot environments, where different services use different platforms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Interoperability</strong>: Describes services calling one another.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><em>Domain/architecture isomorphism</em> is one key characteristic that architects should look for when assessing how appropriate an architecture style is for a particular problem. This term describes how the shape of an architecture maps to a particular architecture style.</p></li><li><p>Architects aspire to extreme decoupling in microservices, but hen often encounter the problem of how to do transactional coordination across services.</p></li><li><p>Building transactions across services boundaries violates the core decoupling principle of the microservices architecture. The best advice for architects who want to do transactions across service is: <em><strong>don&rsquo;t! Fix the granularity components instead</strong></em>. Transaction boundaries is one of the common indicators of service granularity.</p></li><li><p>A few transactions across services is sometimes necessary; if it&rsquo;s the dominant feature of the architecture, mistakes were made!</p></li></ul></li><li><h3 id=architecture-characteristics-ratings-6>Architecture Characteristics Ratings</h3></li></ul><p><img src=https://zhannicholas.github.io/assets/fundamentals-of-software-architecture/fosa_1713.png alt></p><h2 id=chapter-18-choosing-the-appropriate-architecture-style>Chapter 18.

Architects must rely on their past experience&mdash;it is that experience that allowed that person to become an architect in the first place.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Changes in the ecosystem</strong></em>: Constant change is a reliable feature of the software development ecosystem&mdash;everything changes all the time. The change in our ecosystem is particularly chaotic, making even the type of change impossible to predict.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>New capabilities</strong></em>: When new capabilities arise, architecture may not merely replace one tool with
another but rather shift to an entirely new paradigm. The constant change in the ecosystem also delivers a new collection of tools and capabilities on a regular basis. Architects must keep a keen eye open to not only new tools but new paradigms.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Acceleration</strong></em>: Not only does the ecosystem constantly change, but the rate of change also
continues to rise. Architects live in a constant state of flux because change is both pervasive and constant.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Domain changes</strong></em>: The domain that developers write software for constantly shifts and changes, either because the business continues to evolve or because of factors like mergers with other companies.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Technology changes</strong></em>: As technology continues to evolve, organizations try to keep up with at least some of these changes, especially those with obvious bottom-line benefits.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>External factor</strong></em>: Many external factors only peripherally associated with software development may drive change within an organizations.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Regardless of where an organization stands in terms of current

Risk storming is a collaborative exercise used to determine architectural risk within a specific dimension.</p></li><li><p>The risk storming effort involves both an individual part and a collaborative part. In the individual part, all participants individually assign risk to areas of the architecture using the risk matrix. In the collaborative part, all participants work together to gain consensus on risk areas, discuss risk, and form solutions for mitigating the risk.</p></li><li><p>Risk storming is broken down into three primary activities:</p><ul><li><p>Identification</p></li><li><p>Consensus</p></li><li><p>Mitigation</p></li></ul></li><li><h4 id=identification>Identification</h4><ul><li><p>The identification activity of risk storming involves each participant individually identifying areas of risk within the architecture.</p></li><li><p><em>Whenever possible, restrict risk storming efforts to a single dimension. This allows participants to focus their attention to that specific dimension and avoids confusion about multiple risk areas being identified for the same area of the architecture.</em></p></li></ul></li><li><h4 id=consensus>Consensus</h4><ul><li><p>The consensus activity is highly collaborative with the goal of gaining consensus among all participants regarding the risk within the architecture.</p></li><li><p><em>For unproven or unknown technologies, always assign the highest risk rating (9) since the risk matrix cannot be used for this dimension.</em></p></li></ul></li><li><h4 id=mitigation>Mitigation</h4><ul><li>Once all participants agree on the qualification of the risk areas of the architecture, it&rsquo;s time for risk mitigation. Mitigating risk within an architecture usually involves changes or enhancements to certain areas of the architecture that otherwise might have been deemed perfect the way they were.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=chapter-21-diagramming-and-presenting-architecture>Chapter 21. Diagramming and Presenting Architecture</h2><ul><li><p>Effective communication becomes critic to an architect&rsquo;s success. No matter how brilliant an architect&rsquo;s technical ideas, if they can&rsquo;t convince managers to fund them and developers to build them, their brilliance will never manifest.</p></li><li><p>Diagramming and presenting architects are two critical soft skills for architects.</p></li><li><p>When visually descripting an architecture, the creator often must show different views of the architecture. If the architect shows a portion without indicating where it lies within the overall architecture, it confuses viewers. <em><strong>Representational consistency</strong></em> is the practice of always showing the relationship between parts of an architecture, either in diagrams or presentations, before changing views.</p></li><li><h3 id=diagramming>Diagramming</h3><ul><li>The topology of architecture is always of interest to architects and developers because it captures how the structure fits together and forms a valuable shared understanding across the team.</li></ul></li><li><h3 id=presenting>Presenting</h3><ul><li><p>One of the most important skills an architect can learn in their presentation tool of choice is how to manipulate time.</p></li><li><p>When presenting, the speaker has two information channels: verbal and visual. By placing too much text on the slides and then saying the same
words, the presenter is overloading one information channel and starving the other. The better solution to this problem is to use incremental builds for slides, building up (hopefully graphical) information as needed rather than all at once.</p></li><li><p>A common mistake that presenters make is building the entire context of the presentation into the slides. Slides Are Half of the Story.</p></li><li><p><em>Invisibility</em> is a simple pattern where the presenter inserts a blank black slide within a presentation to refocus attention solely on the speaker.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=chapter-22-making-teams-effective>Chapter 22. Making Teams Effective</h2><ul><li><p>Being able to make teams productive is one of the ways effective and successful software architects differentiate themselves from other software architects.</p></li><li><h3 id=team-boundaries>Team Boundaries</h3><ul><li>One of the roles of a software architect is to create and communicate the constraints, or the box in which developers can implement the architecture. Architects can create boundaries that are too tight, too loose, or just right.</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=https://zhannicholas.github.io/assets/fundamentals-of-software-architecture/fosa_2201.png alt></p><ul><li><h3 id=architect-personalities>Architect Personalities</h3><ul><li><p>There are three basic types of architect personalities: A <em>control freak architect</em>, an <em>armchair architect</em>, and an *effective *architect. Control freak architects produce tight boundaries, armchair architects produce loose boundaries, and effective architects produce just the right kinds of boundaries.</p></li><li><h4 id=control-freak>Control Freak</h4><ul><li><p>The control freak architect tries to control every detailed aspect of the software development process. Every decision a control freak architect makes is usually too fine-grained and too low-level, resulting too many constraints on the development team.</p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s very easy to become a control freak architect. An architect&rsquo;s role is to create the building blocks of the application (the components) and
determine the interactions between those components. The developer&rsquo;s role in this effort is to then take those components and determine how they will be implemented using class diagrams and design patterns.</p></li></ul></li><li><h4 id=armchair-architect>Armchair Architect</h4><ul><li><p>The armchair architect is the type of architect who hasn&rsquo;t coded in a very long time (if at all) and doesn&rsquo;t take the implementation details into
account when creating an architecture. They are typically disconnected from the development teams.</p></li><li><p>Armchair architects create loose boundaries around development teams. As a result, development teams end up taking on the role of architect,
essentially doing the work an architect is supposed to be doing. Team velocity and productivity suffer as a result, and teams get confused about how the system should work.</p></li><li><p>The biggest indicator that an architect might falling into the armchair architect personality is not having enough time to spend with the development teams (or choosing not to spend time with the development teams).</p></li><li><p>Development teams need an architect&rsquo;s support and guidance, and they need the architect available for answering technical and business-related questions when they are arise.</p></li></ul></li><li><h4 id=effective-architect>Effective Architect</h4><ul><li>An effective architect produces the appropriate constraints and boundaries on the team, ensuring that the team members are working well together, guided, or even has the appropriate tools.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><h3 id=how-much-control>How Much Control</h3><ul><li><p>Being an effective architect is knowing how much control to exert on a given development team. At least five factors should be considered:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Team familiarity</strong>. Generally, the better team members know each other, the less control is needed because team members start to become self-organizing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Team size</strong>. The larger the team, the more control is needed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Overall experience</strong>. Teams with lots of junior developers require more control and monitoring.</p></li><li><p><strong>Project complexity</strong>. The more complicated the project, the more control is needed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Project duration</strong>. The shorter the duration, the les control is needed.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><h3 id=team-warning-signs>Team Warning Signs</h3><ul><li><p>Team size is one of the factors that influence the amount of control an architect should exert on the development team. Three factors come into play when considering the most effective development team size:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Process loss</strong>. The basic idea of process loss is the more people you add to a project, the more time the project will take.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pluralistic ignorance</strong>. Pluralistic ignorance is when everyone agrees to (but private rejects) a norm because they think they are missing some obvious.</p></li><li><p><strong>Diffusion of responsibility</strong>. This factor is based on the fact that as team size increases, it has a negative impact on communication.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><h3 id=leveraging-checklists>Leveraging Checklists</h3><ul><li><p>Checklists provide an excellent vehicle for making sure everything is covered and addressed.  However, software developers don&rsquo;t require checklists for everything. They key to making teams effective is knowing when to leverage checklists and when not to.</p></li><li><p>Processes that are good candidates for checklists are those that don&rsquo;t have any procedural order or dependent tasks, as well as those that tend to be error-prone or have steps that are frequently missed or skipped.</p></li><li><p>Don&rsquo;t worry about stating the obvious in a checklist. It&rsquo;s the obvious stuff that&rsquo;s usually skipped or missed.</p></li><li><p>***Hawthorne effect: ***<em>If people know they are being observed or monitored, their behavior changes, and generally will do the right thing.</em></p></li></ul></li><li><h3 id=providing-guidance>Providing Guidance</h3><ul><li>A software architect can also make teams effective by providing guidance through the use of design principles.</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=https://zhannicholas.github.io/assets/fundamentals-of-software-architecture/fosa_2213.png alt></p><h2 id=chapter-23-negotiation-and-leadership-skills>Chapter 23.

  + An effective software architect must be pragmatic, yet visionary. To be pragmatic is to deal with things sensibly and realistically in a way that is based on practical rather than theoretical considerations. To be visionary is to think about or plan the future with imagination or wisdom.

  + A good software architect is one that strives to find an appropriate balance between being pragmatic whiling still applying imagination and wisdom to solving problems.

+ #### Leading Teams by Example

  + Bad software architects leverages their title to get people to do what they want them to do. Effective architects get people to do things by not leveraging their title as architect, but rather by leading through example, not by title. ***This is all about gaining the respect of others***.
